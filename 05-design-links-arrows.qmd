# Designing the links/arrows

This chapter concerns the drawing of the links features : their geometry/shape and their semiology.

## Flow mapping tips

1.  Importing flow data (links/nodes)
2.  Processing flow data (indicators calculation, ...)
3.  Geographical data computing (layering, ...)
4.  Statistical data computing (filtering, ...)
5.  **Designing links and arrows (geometry and semiology)**
6.  Designing nodes (semiology)
7.  Map cosmetics (naming, ...)
8.  Export
:::

Sign parameters are set on the left panel - in the layer management section ie. the lower part, which displays at least two geographical layers : one on links and one on nodes.

## Note:

Other geographic information layers (tiles, ...) can also be displayed in this section.

## Designing the links

the design of the links can be modified in two ways: their semiology and their geometry by using the following icons:

![](./images/Icon_links_geom.png) Modify the style of the links

## Links's semiology

![](images/Buton_action_semio.png) Three semiological parameters are available for designing the links : their color, their size and their opacity.

## Links' geometry parameters

Geometry parameter is to change arrow shape

![](images/Buton_action_geom.png) Three geometrical parameters are available for designing the links : their shape, their type, their arrow head and their width

### Links' orientation

The link can be oriented in the form of an arrow or not (remain as a simple line).

![](images/geom_add_links_geometry1.png)

Oriented geometry takes into account the direction of the **flow** to define the **graphic form** of the sign.

## Note about to the orientation

The link's orientation is related to the declared from-to parameter adjusted when the links were imported. See Data importation chapter.

### **Link's types** 

Five forms of flow lines are available.

-   **straight** ;

-   **straight no hook** ;

-   **triangle** ;

-   (line) **curve**

-   **Triangle curve**.

![](images/Links_geom.png)

-   **Straight** (as euclidian distance symbolisation): The link is straight and oriented, with a half arrowhead.

-   **Straight no hook**: The link is straight and oriented, it has a point without hook.

-   **Triangle**: The link is straight and takes the shape of a triangle.

-   **Curve** : The link is curved and oriented, its curvature is configurable in the Arrow head section if selected.

-   **Triangle curve**: The link is curved and takes the shape of a drop of water, its curvature is configurable in the Arrow head section if selected.

-   **Non oriented**: The link is straight, valuate or not, it has no direction.

The arrow geometry - which corresponds to the visual shape variable - can be rectilinear or curvilinear.

### Design of linear arrows

The **straight** and **straight no hook** type of line (oriented as arrows or not) is for rectilinear flow features.

Only the **arrow head** can be set if required.

-   **Arrow head-Height** (curve): The value of the height of the head is the percentage of the map distance of the link (distance between the origin and the destination) used to define the maximum (map) width of the link

-   **Arrow head-Width** being itself a function of the value of the flow, but it can be set as constant here.

### Design curved lines/arrows

The curvature of the line is generated according to the Chaikin algorithm which allows to parameterize its height and its base, with respect to the body of the link.

![](images/Add_links_curve_arrow.png){fig-align="left"}

-   **Height curve**: the (\[0,5\] is identified as a distance from the origin node of the link. Here, the point is approximately in the middle of the curve.

-   **Center Curve:** the value of (\[0,5\]) is that of the center of the curve for a pseudo 3D rendering.
