## Nodes semiology

Drawing the nodes opens a window that allows you to act on their parameters related to semiology, respecting the Jacques Bertin' (1967) principes.

Hereby the general window for changing the semiology and the style of the nodes, regarding three parameters : their color, their size and their toponym (text).

## **Nodes' color**

The colour of a node can be set according to three criteria: a setting mode, a variable and the type of the variable.

### Setting modes of the color

-   **Constant mode** means that the color of the nodes is fixed and identical for all nodes.

![](images/Nodes_color_constant.png)

-   **Conditional mode** means that the color of the nodes will vary according to the character value (of a variable)

The reference for the color schemes is Cynthia Brewer palette for Diverging, Multi Hue and Single Hue. See: [Color Brewer advices for maps](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). An Extra Palette is also proposed in Arabesque.

### Colour variation as a function of a variable

The color of the nodes can be set according to one of the variables (initial or calculated by Arabesque) that are available in the dataset.

### Colour variation as a function of the type of a variable

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
## Caution

The type of color range (Diverging/Multi Hue/Single Hue/Extra Palette) will have to be realized according to the type of the variable to represent (quantitative/qualitative, discrete/continuous, stock/ratio/scale, ...).

The progression (up/down) of the **color range** depends on that of the **value range**: it can be direct or inverse. The checked box means an inverse progression: a light color is applied to a strong value.

## **Node's size**

The size of the nodes can be fixed and the weight defined.

### Nodes' size weighted by a variable

The size of the nodes can be **weighted by a variable** according to one of the initial or additional **variables** available in the dataset (hereby the balance).

![](images/geom_add_nodes_2_size_variable.png)

Three functions to set the size of the node according to the corresponding value are proposed: the square, the square root and the logarithm.

### Nodes' size ratio

The **ratio** representing the max width in pixel of the graphic features can be defined - according to the map bounding box, to obtain an image with balanced features (neither too small nor too big).

## **Node's label (text)**

Textuals elements can also be added near the nodes.

![](images/geom_add_nodes_3_texte.png)

The text can be defined according to one of the variable available in the nodes' dataset, here the name, the type, etc..

The opacity of the text shade (currently set to black) can be set to a given value (here 0.91).

![](images/geom_add_nodes_3_texte_fixe.png)

The opacity of the text shade (currently set to black) can be varied according to an indicator present in the dataset, that is to say : the nodes' original variables and the precalculated ones (degree, ...).

## The nodes' geometric parameters

Not implemented yet. Upcoming projects.
