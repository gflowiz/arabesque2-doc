# Filtering flowdata

This chapter concerns the filtering procedures for flowdata in order to reduce the graphic complexity of the flow map - the so-called *spaghetti effect*.

## Flowmapping tips

1.  Importing flow data (links/nodes)
2.  Processing flow data (indicators calculation, ...)
3.  Geographical data computing (layering, ...)
4.  **Statistical data computing (filtering, ...)**
5.  Cartographic symbolization (designing arrows, ...)
6.  Map cosmetics (naming, ...)
7.  Export
:::

Filtering procedures are also important to select useful information: links and/or nodes to obtain an interesting flowmap.

*EXAMPLE:* RICardo international trade flows like a dish of spaghetti.
