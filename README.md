This is the **Flow mapping with Arabesque** online book.

Arabesque is part of the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) movement.
It is a web application dedicated to flow mapping from origin-destination matrices and spatial networks datasets.

This books presents the functionnalities and how Arabesque 2 can be used to draw flowmaps.

It will be progressively updated following Arabesque 2 current development.

**About** </br>
Arabesque is a part of the **[gFlowiz (geographic flow visualisation)](https://geoflowiz.hypotheses.org)** research project funded by IFSTTAR and then by Univ. Gustave Eiffel,
a project involving several researchers and engineers in an interdisciplinary collaboration focusing on the geovisualisation of OD matrices. 
The group designed and developed a new web application dedicated to flow and spatial networks geovisualization.
