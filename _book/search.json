Arabesques allows users to filter flow data sets (nodes, links and flow values), to play with geographic context (add tiles), reprojecting geography and to parameterise the semiology of the drawings.\nBuilt in javascript and HTML 5, Arabesque provides a full toolset to explore, filter and geovisualize your Origin-Destination matrices. It allows also to build clearer and understandable flow maps that respect the principles of contemporary cartographic semiology.\nArabesque 2 is currently under development.

Simple matrice with 3 columns.\n\n\nThe ID of the place of origin is “CODE_DEP”.\nThe ID of the place of destination is “DEP_ETUD”\nThe flow value is “flow” or is “count”.\nOnce the origin and destination IDs have been identified, they need to be declared in Arabesque for importing flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the matrix is complex (as in that example), you have to choose a method for aggregating the links when importing. [See Complex OD matrices]\n\n\n4.2.2 Complex OD matrices\nThe matrices concerned here are characterized by several attributes, for categorical matrices (e.g. flows that concern several social groups, several goods transported) or for temporal matrices (e.g. flows occur on several dates).\nIf so, agregations procedures are suggested when importing the dataset in Arabesque. By default, the sum function is applied in the lack of any other specifications. However, you can choose to apply an average, minimum, maximum or median function calculated on all the matrices or graphs provided.\nIt is also possible to choose a single date or to aggregate the data, according to a given function, over a period or for categories.\n\nExample: the Mobscol origin-destination. Complex matrice.\n.CSV format\n\n.XLXS format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis OD matrix is available for different categories (i.e. SEXE=“1” or SEXE=“2”), so you will need to choose a method for aggregating the links when importing, hereby the sum function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aggregation function is important because it defines the default flowmap which will be proposed at the entry of Arabesque: the percent of links, nodes and interaction depicted, the intensity of the colors and the opacity of the corresponding signs (see Data processing chapter).\nAfter aggregation, Arabesque will draws only one line (and not as many lines for each attribute in the flow file).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThis aggregation does not interfere with the geo-visualization possibilities that will remain available for all existing attributes. The flow mapping according to one of these attributes can be performed in the filtering section.\n\n\nAfter loading the link and node files, Arabesque automatically performs a join of the common attributes between the two files.",

It is also possible to indicate a threshold.\n\n\n8.1.1.2 Temporal variables\nThe filtering possibilities of the temporal matrices are currently only available for links. They concern the choice of a date or a period, in a numerical or graphical form (slider). Three date formats are available (string, hours, timestamp).\n\n\n8.1.1.3 Categorical variables\nCategorical filtering is applied to nominal qualitative data available in node and/or link datasets. Three possibilities are offered, graphically and numerically:\n– Selection of multiple variables: the user chooses one or more of the available categorical variables (e.g., prefectures and sub-prefectures if a variable specifying the administrative profile of French cities is available) or the type of links (e.g., import or export for trade data);\n– Selection of a single variable: the user chooses a single variable (for the nodes: for example, the flows from and to France for mobility data; the import type flows for trade data);\n– Selection by deletion of a single variable: the user chooses one or more variables relating to the nodes and links to be deleted. If the deletion selection concerns nodes, all the corresponding links (for example, the Ile-de-France region for an analysis at the national level) are deleted.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Implementing filtering\nThe Arabesque filtering possibilities depend on the type of variable/procedure of filtering, as well as the corresponding graph for visual implementation.\nThree main possibilities are proposed\n– (1) visual filtering using modular* selection area (brush) applied on an histogram or an bar chart (see above) ;\n– (2) numerical thresholding by indicating a threshold ;\n\n\n– (3) visual filtering using a slider (hereby, on links)",
